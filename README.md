particule simulation with OpenGL

![alt text](https://github.com/pptacher/sparklepp/blob/master/screenshot.png)

I have reengineered the particle engine from tcoppex/sparkle, to make it compatible with OpenGL 4.1 only hardware (Mac).

Compute shader functionality, atomic counter & shader storage extensions not supported by OpenGL 4.1.
